Welcome to the doghouse inhouse bot setup! By using this command, you'll be able to set what roles and channels your inhouse bot uses.
There are three options for you to choose from:
-Automated setup does everything for you, creating the default roles and channels (you may need to reorganise these afterwards).
-Mixed setup allows you to specify role and channel names, which will be created if they don't already exist on the server.
-Manual setup allows you to choose which roles and channels the bot will use and requires these to already exist in order to proceed.
Please select the option which best suits your needs:
